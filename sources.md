# Source books

## Protestant Bible

Several translations available. I should pick one that works well with the available translations /
copies of other works I can obtain. Like if I have a relatively plain English copy of the Gospel of
Judas, that's a point in favor of using NIV. If I have mostly 1800s translations trying to keep KJV
style, I should use KJV.

## Book of Mormon

In the original English. It's a hilariously bad attempt at mimicking the style of the KJV Bible.

## Catholic Apocrypha

https://www.catholic.org/bible/ has a full version the Bible and the Apocrypha.

Baruch
Esdras

## Nag Hammadi library

AKA the Gnostic Gospels.

A lot of these texts are mere fragments. I've divided the remainder into long and short texts.

### Long texts

* Allogenes (highly broken)
* Apocryphon of James (epistle)
* Apocryphon of John (epistle)
* Gospel of the Egyptians
* Gospel of Philip
* Gospel of Thomas
* Gospel of Truth
* Teachings of Sylvanus (epistle)
* Tripartite Tractate (seems to be theological philosophy, doesn't really fit)

### Short texts

* The Acts of Peter and the Twelve Apostles
* Revelation of Adam
* First Apocalypse of James
* Second Apocalypse of James
* Apocalypse of Paul
* Apocalypse of Peter
* Asclepius
* Discourse on the Eighth and Ninth
* Eugnostos the Blessed
* Exegesis of the Soul
* Reality of the Rulers
* Letter of Peter to Philip
* Sophia (Wisdom) of Jesus Christ
* The Thunder, Perfect Mind
* Treatise on the Resurrection
* Three Forms of First Thought


# Passage classification

* History (Kings, Chronicles, Ruth)
* Law (Leviticus, Deuteronomy)
* Gospel
  * Sermon (Sermon on the Mount)
  * Parable (Parable of the Ten Minas)
  * History (Jesus' entry into Jerusalem)
* Prophecy (Revelation, Isaiah)
* Epistle (1 John, 2 Corinthians)
* Advice (Ecclesiastes, Proverbs, Silvanus)

I'm going to classify just at the level of a full book.
