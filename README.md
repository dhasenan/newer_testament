# The Newer Testament

Ever wish the Bible went on forever? Now it can!

This is a [NaNoGenMo 2019](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2019) project that creates a 50k word text.
NaNoGenMo starts on 1 November 2019, so if you don't see code here or the code doesn't output
anything, you're probably too early!

The Newer Testament will be generated by generating a Markov model from the Christian Bible, then
using that to choose a sequence of verses. Once those verses are chosen, they'll be mutated further,
because we have no sense of propriety. We'll also fix up punctuation as possible.

Stretch goals:

* Come up with a decent way of making book names.
* Figure out a clean way of closing chapters. Maybe add a special "end-of-chapter" verse?
* Identify names and reassign them consistently as a separate step.
* Identify quotes. Attribute them to specific people. Make a different style of speech for each (eg
  prefer particular synonyms out of each synonym set).
